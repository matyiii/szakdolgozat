# 3D Model Sharing and Community Platform

## Overview

This project aims to create a web platform for sharing and discovering 3D models, focused on building a community for 3D printing enthusiasts. Users can upload, share, and get feedback on their models, while also engaging with others through ratings, reviews, and forum discussions.
Existing platforms for 3D model sharing, like Printables and Thingiverse, offer similar features but are often limited or fragmented.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: Registration, login, and profile management
- **3D Model Upload and Sharing**: Central feature for uploading and sharing designs
- **Search**: Helps users quickly find specific models
- **Forum**: A place for discussions and community interaction
- **Admin Panel**: For managing content and user interactions

## Technologies Used

- **Docker**: To set up the development environment
- **Database**: For storing user accounts and 3D models
- **Backend**: Built with PHP and Laravel
- **Frontend**: Built with React (Typescript + Tailwind + Redux)
